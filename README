6. Exploring Different Types of Inheritance with the "Vehicles" Domain Model
For this exercise, we'll dive into the world of vehicles. Your task is to design three separate packages in Java to
demonstrate the three types of inheritance: Single, Multilevel, and Hierarchical.
Package 1: Single Inheritance
Domain Model: Bicycles
Classes:
● Bicycle
● MountainBike (inherits from Bicycle)
Attributes:
● Bicycle: speed, gear
● MountainBike: tireType, suspension
Methods:
● Bicycle: changeGear(), speedUp(), applyBrake()
● MountainBike: adjustSuspension()Challenge
Package 2: Multilevel Inheritance
Domain Model: Cars
Classes:
● Car
● ElectricCar (inherits from Car)
● Tesla (inherits from ElectricCar)
Attributes:
● Car: make, model, year
● ElectricCar: batteryCapacity, range
● Tesla: autopilotVersion
Methods:
● Car: start(), stop(), accelerate()
● ElectricCar: charge()
● Tesla: enableAutopilot()Challenge
Package 3: Hierarchical Inheritance
Domain Model: Watercraft
Classes:
● Boat
● SpeedBoat (inherits from Boat)
● FishingBoat (inherits from Boat)
Attributes:
● Boat: length, weight
● SpeedBoat: maxSpeed, engineType
● FishingBoat: fishCapacity, typeOfNet
Methods:
● Boat: sail()
● SpeedBoat: turboBoost()
● FishingBoat: castNet()
Note: While the aforementioned attributes and methods are suggestions, feel free to be creative and add any other attributes or methods you
deem relevant
