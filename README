Challenge
1. Create an Animal class with sound() method that prints to console “animal makes
sounds”
2. Create a Dog class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method; dogs make a
particular sound, so we want to print “Dog barks!”, in this case
3. Create a Cat class that extends Animal and overrides sound() method, and in this case,
we want to print in our method “Cat meow!”
4. Create a Wolf class that extends Animal, and overrides sound() method, and print “Wolf how!”
5. Create a TestAnimal Class with a main method, create objects with each animal class
created (dog, cat, wolf) and call sound()
myNote:
I changed a bit the animals action texts.
